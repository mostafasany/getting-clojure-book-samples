; And now for the big reveal: Clojure opts for the wrapper method. Clojure calls its generic collection wrappers sequences. 
; Under the hood there are as many flavors of sequences as there are collection types, 
; but to the outside world all sequences provide a very uniform interface: no matter if itâ€™s a vector or a map or a list or a set behind a sequence,
;  one sequence looks exactly like another.
